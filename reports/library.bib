abstract = {The sleep of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients is often disturbed by medications, depression, circadian rhythm changes and sleep disorders. Institutionalization is often precipitated by the effect of the patient's sleep and wakefulness on the caregiver. We examined reports of sleep disturbance in mild AD patients. The study cohort consisted of 246 AD patients and 94 controls. Self-reports of sleep disturbance in mild AD patients were examined as was the relationship of sleep and medication use. Results were compared to those of normal controls, and the patients' responses to the reports of their caregivers. Dementia was assessed with the Mini Mental Status Exam, the Blessed Dementia Scale, the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, and the Pfeiffer Outpatient Disability Test. The more demented the patients, the more time they spent in bed, the more fragmented their sleep, and the more naps they took. Caregivers reports of increased wandering at night and more aggressive behavior during the day were associated with increased use of sedative-hypnotics and with going to bed early. Lengthy sleep was associated with disruptive behavior. We conclude that increased sleep may be associated with dementia and with more disruptive behavior.},

abstract = {We consider the machine vision task of pose estimation from static images, specifically for the case of articulated objects. This problem is hard because of the large number of degrees of freedom to be estimated. Following a established line of research, pose estimation is framed as inference in a probabilistic model. In our experience however, the success of many approaches often lie in the power of the features. Our primary contribution is a novel casting of visual inference as an iterative parsing process, where one sequentially learns better and better features tuned to a particular image. We show quantitative results for human pose estimation on a database of over 300 images that suggest our algorithm is competitive with or surpasses the state-of-the-art. Since our procedure is quite general (it does not rely on face or skin detection), we also use it to estimate the poses of horses in the Weizmann database. 1},

abstract = {Motion detection is the first essential process in the extraction of information regarding moving objects and makes use of stabilization in functional areas, such as tracking, classification, recognition, and so on. In this paper, we propose a novel and accurate approach to motion detection for the automatic video surveillance system. Our method achieves complete detection of moving objects by involving three significant proposed modules: a background modeling (BM) module, an alarm trigger (AT) module, and an object extraction (OE) module. For our proposed BM module, a unique two-phase background matching procedure is performed using rapid matching followed by accurate matching in order to produce optimum background pixels for the background model. Next, our proposed AT module eliminates the unnecessary examination of the entire background region, allowing the subsequent OE module to only process blocks containing moving objects. Finally, the OE module forms the binary object detection mask in order to achieve highly complete detection of moving objects. The detection results produced by our proposed (PRO) method were both qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed through visual inspection and for accuracy, along with comparisons to the results produced by other state-of-the-art methods. The analyses show that our PRO method has a substantially higher degree of efficacy, outperforming other methods by an <formula formulatype="inline"> <tex Notation="TeX">\$F\_\{1\}\$</tex></formula> metric accuracy rate of up to 53.43\%.},

abstract = {In this paper a method for moving objects segmentation and tracking from the so-called permanency matrix is introduced. Our motion-based algorithms enable to obtain the shapes of moving objects in video sequences starting from those image pixels where a change in their grey levels is detected between two consecutive frames by means of the permanency values. In the segmentation phase matching between objects along the image sequence is performed by using fuzzy bi-dimensional rectangular regions. The tracking phase performs the association between the various fuzzy regions in all the images through time. Finally, the analysis phase describes motion through a long video sequence. Segmentation, tracking an analysis phases are enhanced through the use of fuzzy logic techniques, which enable to work with the uncertainty of the permanency values due to image noise inherent to computer vision. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {PURPOSE: Physically active individuals have a lower risk of developing colorectal cancer but the influence of exercise on cancer survival is unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: By a prospective, observational study of 573 women with stage I to III colorectal cancer, we studied colorectal cancer-specific and overall mortality according to predefined physical activity categories before and after diagnosis and by change in activity after diagnosis. To minimize bias by occult recurrences, we excluded women who died within 6 months of their postdiagnosis physical activity assessment. RESULTS: Increasing levels of exercise after diagnosis of nonmetastatic colorectal cancer reduced cancer-specific mortality (P for trend = .008) and overall mortality (P for trend = .003). Compared with women who engaged in less than 3 metabolic equivalent task [MET] -hours per week of physical activity, those engaging in at least 18 MET-hours per week had an adjusted hazard ratio for colorectal cancer-specific mortality of 0.39 (95\% CI, 0.18 to 0.82) and an adjusted hazard ratio for overall mortality of 0.43 (95\% CI, 0.25 to 0.74). These results remained unchanged even after excluding women who died within 12 and 24 months of activity assessment. Prediagnosis physical activity was not predictive of mortality. Women who increased their activity (when comparing prediagnosis to postdiagnosis values) had a hazard ratio of 0.48 (95\% CI, 0.24 to 0.97) for colorectal cancer deaths and a hazard ratio of 0.51 (95\% CI, 0.30 to 0.85) for any-cause death, compared with those with no change in activity. CONCLUSION: Recreational physical activity after the diagnosis of stages I to III colorectal cancer may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer-specific and overall mortality.},

@article{Li2010,
abstract = {A major challenge in applying Bayesian tracking methods for tracking 3D human body pose is the high dimensionality of the pose state space. It has been observed that the 3D human body pose parameters typically can be assumed to lie on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional space. The goal of this work is to approximate the low-dimensional manifold so that a lowdimensional state vector can be obtained for efficient and effective Bayesian tracking. To achieve this goal, a globally coordinated mixture of factor analyzers is learned from motion capture data. Each factor analyzer in the mixture is a “locally linear dimensionality reducer” that approximates a part of the manifold. The global parametrization of the manifold is obtained by aligning these locally linear pieces in a global coordinate system. To enable automatic and optimal selection of the number of factor analyzers and the dimensionality of the manifold, a variational Bayesian formulation of the globally coordinated mixture of factor analyzers is proposed. The advantages of the proposed model are demonstrated in a multiple hypothesis tracker for tracking 3D human body pose. Quantitative comparisons on bench-mark datasets show that the proposed method produces more accurate 3D pose estimates over time than those obtained from two previously proposed Bayesian tracking methods.},

abstract = {A method is introduced to track the object's motion and estimate its pose directly from 2-D image sequences. Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) is used to extract corresponding feature points from image sequences. We demonstrate that pose estimation from the corresponding feature points can be formed as a solution to Sylvester's equation. We show that the proposed approach to the solution of Sylvester's equation is equivalent to the classical SVD method for 3D-3D pose estimation. However, whereas classical SVD cannot be used for pose estimation directly from 2-D image sequences, our method based on Sylvester's equation provides a new approach to pose estimation. Smooth video tracking and pose estimation is finally obtained by using the solution to Sylvester's equation within the importance sampling density of the particle filtering framework. Finally, computer simulation experiments conducted over synthetic data and real-world videos demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both robustness and speed compared with other similar object tracking and pose estimation methods.},

abstract = {A Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) was evaluated in a sample of community-dwelling, older adults. Respondents were randomly assigned to complete the PASE by mail or telephone before or after a home visit assessment. Item weights for the PASE were derived by regressing a physical activity principal component score on responses to the PASE. The component score was based on 3-day motion sensor counts, a 3-day physical activity diary and a global activity self-assessment. Test-retest reliability, assessed over a 3-7 week interval, was 0.75 (95\% CI = 0.69-0.80). Reliability for mail administration (r = 0.84) was higher than for telephone administration (r = 0.68). Construct validity was established by correlating PASE scores with health status and physiologic measures. As hypothesized, PASE scores were positively associated with grip strength (r = 0.37), static balance (r = +0.33), leg strength (r = 0.25) and negatively correlated with resting heart rate (r = - 0.13), age (r = - 0.34) and perceived health status (r = -0.34); and overall Sickness Impact Profile score (r = -0.42). The PASE is a brief, easily scored, reliable and valid instrument for the assessment of physical activity in epidemiologic studies of older people.},

abstract = {We present a hierarchical method for human pose estimation from a single still image. In our approach, a dependency graph representing relationships between reference points such as body joints is constructed and the positions of these reference points are sequentially estimated by a successive application of multidimensional output regressions along the dependency paths, starting from the root node. Each regressor takes image features computed from an image patch centered on the current node's position estimated by the previous regressor and is specialized for estimating its child nodes' positions. The use of the dependency graph allows us to decompose a complex pose estimation problem into a set of local pose estimation problems that are less complex. We design a dependency graph for two commonly used human pose estimation datasets, the Buffy Stickmen dataset and the ETHZ PASCAL Stickmen dataset, and demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art results on both datasets with significantly lower computation time than existing methods. Furthermore, we propose an importance weighted boosted regression trees method for transductive learning settings and demonstrate the resulting improved performance for pose estimation tasks.},

abstract = {Most existing techniques for articulated Human Pose Estimation (HPE)consider each person independently. Here we tackle the problem in a new setting,coined Human Pose Coestimation (PCE), where multiple people are in a common,but unknown pose. The task of PCE is to estimate their poses jointly and toproduce prototypes characterizing the shared pose. Since the poses of the individual people should be similar to the prototype, PCE has less freedom compared to estimating each pose independently, which simplifies the problem.We demonstrate our PCE technique on two applications. The first is estimating the pose of people performing the same activity synchronously, such as during aerobics, cheerleading, and dancing in a group. We show that PCE improves pose estimation accuracy over estimating each person independently. The second application is learning prototype poses characterizing a pose class directly from an image search engine queried by the class name (e.g., “lotus pose”). We show that PCE leads to better pose estimation in such images, and it learns meaningful prototypes which can be used as priors for pose estimation in novel images.},

In the core technology, three critical processing stages are thoroughly discussed mainly: human object segmentation, feature extraction and representation, activity detection and classification algorithms. In the human activity recognition systems, three main types are mentioned, including single person activity recognition, multiple people interaction and crowd behavior, and abnormal activity recognition. Finally the domains of applications are discussed in detail, specifically, on surveillance environments, entertainment environments and healthcare systems. Our survey, which aims to provide a comprehensive state-of-the-art review of the field, also addresses several challenges associated with these systems and applications. Moreover, in this survey, various applications are discussed in great detail, specifically, a survey on the applications in healthcare monitoring systems.},

abstract = {A new method of physical activity monitoring is presented, which is able to detect body postures (sitting, standing, and lying) and periods of walking in elderly persons using only one kinematic sensor attached to the chest. The wavelet transform, in conjunction with a simple kinematics model, was used to detect different postural transitions (PTs) and walking periods during daily physical activity. To evaluate the system, three studies were performed. The method was first tested on 11 community-dwelling elderly subjects in a gait laboratory where an optical motion system (Vicon) was used as a reference system. In the second study, the system was tested for classifying PTs (i.e., lying-to-sitting, sitting-to-lying, and turning the body in bed) in 24 hospitalized elderly persons. Finally, in a third study monitoring was performed on nine elderly persons for 45-60 min during their daily physical activity. Moreover, the possibility-to-perform long-term monitoring over 12 h has been shown. The first study revealed a close concordance between the ambulatory and reference systems. Overall, subjects performed 349 PTs during this study. Compared with the reference system, the ambulatory system had an overall sensitivity of 99\% for detection of the different PTs. Sensitivities and specificities were 93\% and 82\% in sit-to-stand, and 82\% and 94\% in stand-to-sit, respectively. In both first and second studies, the ambulatory system also showed a very high accuracy (> 99\%) in identifying the 62 transfers or rolling out of bed, as well as 144 different posture changes to the back, ventral, right and left sides. Relatively high sensitivity (> 90\%) was obtained for the classification of usual physical activities in the third study in comparison with visual observation. Sensitivities and specificities were, respectively, 90.2\% and 93.4\% in sitting, 92.2\% and 92.1\% in "standing + walking," and, finally, 98.4\% and 99.7\% in lying. Overall detection errors (as percent of range) were 3.9\% for "standing + walking," 4.1\% for sitting, and 0.3\% for lying. Finally, overall symmetric mean average errors were 12\% for "standing + walking," 8.2\% for sitting, and 1.3\% for lying.},

@article{Chen2003,
abstract = {In this self-contained survey/review paper, we system- atically investigate the roots of Bayesian filtering as well as its rich leaves in the literature. Stochastic filtering theory is briefly reviewed with emphasis on nonlinear and non-Gaussian filtering. Following the Bayesian statistics, different Bayesian filtering techniques are de- veloped given different scenarios. Under linear quadratic Gaussian circumstance, the celebrated Kalman filter can be derived within the Bayesian framework. Optimal/suboptimal nonlinear filtering tech- niques are extensively investigated. In particular, we focus our at- tention on the Bayesian filtering approach based on sequential Monte Carlo sampling, the so-called particle filters. Many variants of the particle filter as well as their features (strengths and weaknesses) are discussed. Related theoretical and practical issues are addressed in detail. In addition, some other (new) directions on Bayesian filtering are also explored.},

@article{Moeslund2001,
abstract = {A comprehensive survey of computer vision-based human motion capture literature from the past two decades is presented. The focus is on a general overview based on a taxonomy of system functionalities, broken down into four processes: initialization, tracking, pose estimation, and recognition. Each process is discussed and divided into subprocesses and/or categories of methods to provide a reference to describe and compare the more than 130 publications covered by the survey. References are included throughout the paper to exemplify important issues and their relations to the various methods. A number of general assumptions used in this research field are identified and the character of these assumptions indicates that the research field is still in an early stage of development. To evaluate the state of the art, the major application areas are identified and performances are analyzed in light of the methods presented in the survey. Finally, suggestions for future research directions are offered.},

abstract = {We introduce the publicly available TUM Kitchen Data Set as a comprehensive collection of activity sequences recorded in a kitchen environment equipped with multiple complementary sensors. The recorded data consists of observations of naturally performed manipulation tasks as encountered in everyday activities of human life. Several instances of a table-setting task were performed by different subjects, involving the manipulation of objects and the environment. We provide the original video sequences, full-body motion capture data recorded by a markerless motion tracker, RFID tag readings and magnetic sensor readings from objects and the environment, as well as corresponding action labels. In this paper, we both describe how the data was computed, in particular the motion tracker and the labeling, and give examples what it can be used for. We present first results of an automatic method for segmenting the observed motions into semantic classes, and describe how the data can be integrated in a knowledge-based framework for reasoning about the observations.},
